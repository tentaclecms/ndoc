=============

A nDoc module.

At the moment nDocs output is full HTML, With some modifications to the builder you can generate a headless HTML file.

Create a folder under your theme called docs. more your nDoc souce over to this folder.

You should have 

/docs/
/docs/files/
/docs/styles/
/docs/javascript/

The Styles and Javascript should contain the generated code from nDocs but can be moved as your themes assets will be loaded.

Add [docs file.html] to your page content, where file.html is your defailt file to be loaded.

Thats it!
